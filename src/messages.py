Thank you, Doctor, for agreeing to speak with me.
While I realise that your profession ultimately affects your judgement of my character,
I sincerely hope that you'll lend me an impartial ear until I'm finished with my story.

I've been to Hell and back, Doctor. Literally... Hell. With a capital H.

I can see your lips attempting to conceal a smile. That's alright. I've had far worse reactions.
Know that my journey has absolved me. Of all doubt. Of all fear.
I'll tell my story as I experienced it. I will leave no detail obscured by either shame or decency.
 
I was young at the time. Young and foolish.
That morning, I woke up in my bedroom with a bad hangover.
I tried recalling the night before - it started with a party -
But I couldn't remember how it ended, and how I got back home.  
Anyway, I woke up. Hangover. Felt like shit. Nothing out of the ordinary.'''
